<h1>Activities</h1>
An Activity workflow is the smallest grain size of workflows, showing a step by step procedure for the activity. An activity should generally correspond to something that could be completed in a single session, however sometimes activities will span multiple sessions or the entire class. An activity is made up of smaller tasks, which are organized into columns based on where they take place and by whom they are led. An activity can be embedded within a course, or simply kept on its own.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, give your activity a title. This can be done by hovering over its button in the Layout panel to the left then clicking the edit icon, or by double clicking its title when the activity is active. Then, drag nodes from the Nodes panel to the right and drop them into the active area (the box).

<h3>Details</h3>

<h4>Columns</h4>

By default, an activity is made up of three columns: Out of Class &ndash; for tasks which are completed outside the classroom, In Class (Instructor) &ndash; for tasks which are primarily instructor-led, and In Class (Students) &ndash; for tasks which are primarily student-led.

<h4>Nodes</h4>

The nodes in an activity workflow represent tasks, which are each a single event or piece of the activity. The task icons are used to denote tasks that require student engagement: the left icon shows the context (individual, group, or class), while the right icon represents how the students are being engaged. Icons should be left out when there is no student engagement (for example procedural steps such as splitting the students into groups). To edit a node, click on the node to bring up the edit menu.

<h4>Strategies</h4>

Some activities make use of Strategies: scripts of tasks which represent validated techniques, such as Jigsaw and Peer Instruction. The strategies panel to the right allows you to quickly implement the strategy in your activity workflow then modify it for your own use. You can add the entire strategy (group of tasks) by dragging the strategy and dropping it into the active area. Alternatively, if you have created an activity and identified an existing strategy within it, you can drag the strategy directly onto a node to simply add the bracket.
