<h1>General Help</h1>

Welcome to CourseFlow, a pedagogical tool for planning activities, courses, and programs, which is designed to enable Research Practice Partnerships between instructors, designers, and researchers. This program constructs Workflows, a generalized flowchart representation of activities, courses, and programs. These are stored in a Project, which can be named by clicking on the edit icon to the right of the title.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, create an activity, course, or program in the Layout on the left, or begin by designing the desired Outcomes for your course.

<h3>Menu Items</h3>

<h4>File</h4>

<ul>
<li>New Project</li>Creates a project, clearing any unsaved data.
<li>Save Project</li>Saves the current project, giving the file a default name identical to the project title. The file will be saved to your Downloads folder, and should then be moved into a local directory of your choice.
<li>Open File</li>Opens a project from your computer.
<li>Export Current Workflow</li>Exports the currently active workflow (for example a course or activity) and any workflows and outcomes used by it. For example, when exporting a course, the exported file would include its outcomes and any activities that were used by it, but not a program that contained it.
<li>Import a Workflow</li>Imports a workflow generated with Export Current Workflow or an entire project, appending it to your current project without overwriting any information. This, along with the Export function, can be used to share activities or courses.
</ul>

<h4>Edit</h4>

<ul>
<li>Undo/Redo</li>Undoes/redoes the most recent change to a workflow. This function may take some time to execute.
<li>Duplicate Current Workflow</li>Creates a copy of the currently active workflow or outcome.
</ul>


<h4>View</h4>

<ul>
<li>Expand/Collapse All Nodes</li>Expands or collapses all nodes within a workflow, showing or hiding the detailed descriptions.
<li>Printer Friendly Version</li>Opens a new tab with a printer friendly version of the currently active workflow. This can be used to export to pdf.
</ul>
