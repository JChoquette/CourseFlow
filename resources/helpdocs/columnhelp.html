<h1>Columns</h1>

Workflows are organized into columns into which the nodes are sorted. The exact columns depend on the type of workflow. Columns are added automatically to new workflows.

<h3>Manipulating Columns</h3>

<ul>
<li>Moving Columns</li>To move a column, click and drag the head of the column (the icon). This allows you to rearrange the columns to your liking.
<li>Adding Columns</li>Sometimes a workflow can have more than just the default columns. When you insert a node of a type that does not currently have a column, a new column will be created automatically.
</ul>
