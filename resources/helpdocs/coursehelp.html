<h1>Courses</h1>

A Course workflow is used to design or represent an entire course. It can be embedded within a program, and can be composed of activities.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, give your course a title. This can be done by hovering over its button in the Layout panel to the left then clicking the edit icon, or by double clicking its title when the activity is active. Then, drag nodes from the Nodes panel to the right and drop them into the active area (the box).

<h3>Details</h3>

<h4>Columns</h4>

By default, a course is made up of three columns: Activity &ndash; for activities, which form the backbone of the course, Preparation &ndash; to indicate tasks such as reading assignments which must be completed prior to the activity's completion, and Assessment &ndash; to indicate where students are being evaluated.

<h4>Nodes</h4>

The nodes within a course are meant to show the overall design and flow of the course from start to finish. Unlike at the activity level, nodes are not linked by default, as the relationship between nodes is not as simple. Links between nodes should be made to illustrate the flow of information: for example the preparation for an activity (which might be a reading assignment) may not occur directly before the activity itself; instead it might occur in the previous week. The link between these should be illustrated by creating links between the two nodes. Nodes may have a linked activity, which indicates that the activity workflow is to be used in the course. The nodes also have an icon which the user may set, corresponding to the strategy (if any) employed in the corresponding workflow. In the case of assessment nodes, the icon instead represents the assessment type. This determines the category of the node in the outcomes view.

<h4>Weeks</h4>

A course is by default organized into weeks. For users who prefer to plan their course by topic or concept (or class by class), the "weeks" can be renamed by double clicking the text to be given a custom name.

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

Outcomes can be assigned to a course in the right hand panel. Once a Program outcome has been created, it can be assigned to the course by selecting it in the dropdown menu in the panel then clicking "Assign to Course". The outcomes will then appear in the panel, and can be dragged onto nodes to assign the outcome to the node.
