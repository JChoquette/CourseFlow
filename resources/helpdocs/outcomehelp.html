<h1>Outcomes</h1>
Outcomes are used to track your learning objectives or course competencies. They are produced at three levels: Program outcomes, Course outcomes, and Activity outcomes.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, click the "Create New" button under Outcomes in the left panel. This will create a new Program level outcome. You can then click on the outcome's text to edit it. When you mouse over the outcome, you will see the <img src = "../images/createchild16.png"> symbol appear. Click on this to create a new outcome at the next level &ndash; in this case a Course level outcome. Clicking this button for a Course outcome will instead create an Activity outcome.

<h3>Types of Outcomes</h3>

Outcomes are sorted by level:

<ul>
 <li>Program Outcomes</li>A Program outcome is the top-most level: it is a learning outcome that would be designed at the curriculum development stage. Often the Program outcomes for a program will roughly correspond to the different courses, and in some fields may match up one to one with individual courses. These are sometimes called Competencies.
<li>Course Outcomes</li>A Course outcome is the next highest level: a program outcome is made up of probably 3-8 course outcomes, which are the main broad points a course should address. These might correspond to units in a course or be more nebulous depending on the field of study. These are sometimes called Competency Elements.
<li>Activity Outcomes</li>An Activity outcome is the finest grain outcome. This should correspond to specific things a student should learn or be able to do after taking the course. They should generally be something that an activity will be specifically geared to address, either in part or entirely.
</ul>

<h3>Assigning Outcomes</h3>

Program outcomes can be assigned to courses with the right hand panel to signify that the course will address the outcome either in part or entirely. Once the outcome has been assigned, the individual Activity outcomes can be assigned to individual nodes by dragging them onto the node. You can also assign a Course outcome this way, which may be useful if an assessment (such as an exam) addresses all the Activity outcomes within the Course outcome.

As you add outcomes, indicators will appear next to the outcome to display to which types of nodes it has been assigned. Generally speaking, each Activity outcome should be addressed in each column: the students should be prepared for the outcome, there should be an activity which addresses it, and the students should be assessed on that outcome. Once the outcome has been assigned to at least one node in each column, the indicators will turn to a green checkmark to denote that the outcome has been fully addressed (at least in theory). When all Activity outcomes have been addressed, the Course outcome will also be addressed, and when all Course outcomes have been addressed so will the Program outcome.

To see which outcomes have been assigned to a node, mouse over it. To see to which nodes a specific outcome has been assigned, you can mouse over it to highlight all nodes, or click it to toggle highlighting on/off. To remove an outcome from the node, mouse over the outcome attached to the node and click the <img src = "../images/del24.png" width="16px"> icon on the outcome.
