<h1>Nodes</h1>

Nodes are the primary building blocks of the workflows, and mean different things based on whether they are at the Program, Course, or Activity level.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, open or create any workflow. To add nodes to the workflow, click and drag the nodes from the right hand panel into the active area (the box). Once a node has been created, more nodes can be created directly below it by clicking the <img src = "../images/add24.png" width="16px"> icon.

<h3>Manipulating Nodes</h3>

<h4>Editing Nodes</h4>

Nodes can be edited by clicking on the node to bring up the Edit Node panel, or by right clicking the node to bring up a popup menu. Nodes can have the following properties (not all of which will appear for each type of node):

<ul>
<li>Title</li>A short title which will appear at the top of the node.
<li>Left/Right Icon</li>Icons which denote the nature of the task or activity.
<li>Description</li>A longer description. This is hidden by default, however it can be toggled by expanding the drop-down below the node. Once the drop-down is shown, it can be resized manually.
<li>Linked Workflow</li>Links a workflow to this node. For example, an Activity node in a Course Workflow can be linked to an Activity workflow to denote that activity is used here. Double clicking the node will automatically open the linked workflow.
<li>Tags</li>This is used to assign or remove outcomes to the node.
</ul>

<h4>Manipulating Nodes</h4>

Nodes can be manipulated in various ways:

<ul>
<li>Moving Nodes</li>Nodes can be moved between columns (with a few exceptions) or rearranged in time by clicking and dragging the node.
<li>Deleting Nodes</li>Nodes can be deleted by clicking the <img src = "../images/delrect16.png"> icon which appears in the top right corner of the node when hovered over.
<li>Cloning Nodes</li>Nodes can be cloned by clicking the <img src = "../images/copy24.png" width="16px"> icon which appears on the right hand side of the node when hovered over.
<li>Linking Nodes</li>Nodes can be linked by clicking and dragging the handles (<img src = "../images/port24.png" width="16px">) which appear when the node is hovered over, then connected to the handles of another node. Some links will appear automatically (such as in Activities) but you may want to add your own as well.
<li>Displaying Description</li>The description can be displayed by clicking the drop-down at the bottom of the node.
<li>Resizing Nodes</li>Once the drop-down has been displayed, the size of the node can be altered to show the full description.
</ul>
