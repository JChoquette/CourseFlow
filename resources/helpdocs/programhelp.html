<h1>Programs</h1>

A Program workflow is used to design or represent a curriculum.


<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, give your program a title. This can be done by hovering over its button in the Layout panel to the left then clicking the edit icon, or by double clicking its title when the program is active. Then, drag nodes from the Nodes panel to the right and drop them into the active area (the box).

<h3>Details</h3>

<h4>Columns</h4>

By default, a program is made up of three columns, each corresponding to course categories. An arbitrary number of these can be added and customized to divide your program as you see fit.

<h4>Nodes</h4>

The nodes within a program each represent an individual course, and can be linked to a course workflow. Unlike at the course and activity level, a linear time progression is not relevant. Courses can be organized into terms, but can be positioned side by side within a term.

<h4>Terms</h4>

A program is by default organized into terms. For some users it may be better to organize these by year or level, in which case the "terms" can be renamed by double clicking the text to be given a custom name.

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

Outcomes can be assigned to a program in the right hand panel. Once a Program outcome has been created, it can be assigned to the program by selecting it in the dropdown menu in the panel then clicking "Assign to Course". The outcomes will then appear in the panel, and can be dragged onto nodes to assign the outcome to the node.
