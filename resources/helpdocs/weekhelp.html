<h1>Weeks</h1>

A Course workflow is divided into weeks. By default, the workflow always contains one week. The week can be renamed to be given a title or to organize your course by topic/unit by double clicking the text.

<h3>Manipulating Weeks</h3>

Weeks can be manipulated in various ways:

<ul>
<li>Adding Weeks</li>To add a week below another, click the <img src = "../images/add24.png" width="16px"> icon that appears when you hover over the week.
<li>Deleting Weeks</li>A week can be deleted by clicking the <img src = "../images/delrect16.png"> icon that appears when you hover over it. All nodes contained within it will also be deleted.
<li>Cloning Weeks</li>To duplicate a week, and all its contents, click the <img src = "../images/copy24.png" width="16px"> icon that appears when you hover over the week.
</ul>
