<h1>The Layout</h1>

The layout shows the organization of your project at all levels, showing how your workflows are arranged.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

As you add workflows (whether Activity, Course, or Program), buttons for each will appear in the layout automatically. By hovering over these buttons, the workflows can be renamed (<img src = "../images/edit16.png">), deleted (<img src = "../images/delrect16.png">), or reordered (<img src = "../images/moveup16.png"> / <img src = "../images/movedown16.png">).

<h3>Changing the Layout</h3>

The layout shows the organization, and will therefore change as you assign activities to courses or assign courses to programs. Workflows can be assigned to others by clicking on the appropriate node then selecting the Linked Workflow in the edit menu. Whenever a workflow is assigned to another, its button in the layout is moved under the corresponding button. These sub-workflows are hidden by default, but can be shown or hidden by toggling the <img src = "../images/plus16.png"> / <img src = "../images/minus16.png"> icon.

If a workflow is assigned to more than one other (for example if an activity is used in multiple courses), it will appear under both. Changing it in one will change both however, so if you want to create a copy of the workflow that can be altered you should instead use Duplicate Current Workflow under the Edit menu.

Removing a workflow from another will remove the button from the layout. If the workflow has been removed from all others, its button will appear in the default position.
