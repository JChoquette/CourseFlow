Student Feedback McGill:
 Here is a list of feedback from students which could potentially make the CFlow more useful:
    They suggested creating a little tutorial video on the info shown in CFlow (which I can do) and some text/legends to explain the different content.
    In the main view, it would potentially be better to have the course learning outcomes higher on the list and the graduate attributes at the end (though I imagine this just depends on the order of data entry?)
    In the main categories (e.g. Chem eng fundamentals etc) which we proposed they think we should add a "Computational courses" category. If we can create our own icons and categories I can do this myself or test out what it looks like if I add this.
More relevant to you:
    Can we make the "toggle" to the outcome view a bit more obvious (larger button maybe)?
    In the error messages, can we add input about which semester a course is offered - some courses are only offered in fall or winter. If a student drags a fall course into a winter term ideally there would be an error message about this.


McGill stuff:
	(100+100) New icons/set them up with ability to change icons
		columns: General, Chemical Engineering Fundamentals, Science-Based Courses, Experiential and Design-Based Courses, Specialized Courses
	(100) Engineering-specific nomenclature
	(1500) validation(?)
	(1000) training and implementation
		Create their own forked project
		Work with the student
	(200) student view options
		Option to not allow students to change the category of a course
		Read only
		hide/show comments
		show/hide arrows by default (could make them width 0 but then they still get highlighted on click and hover)
make the <!> thing have a <?> mouseover arrow
	
	
	
Unbudgeted stuff:
	Make courses only draggable to particular semesters (like winter/fall)
	Different outcome types for graduate attributes or soft skills
	Cross-heirarchy linking
	Make it so that different levels in the heirarchy are independent (if you have KB.1 KB.2 KB.3, don't necessarily have KB and vice versa)
	Be able to "move" (change nodes of) arrows
	In theory we could have the hours breakdown inclass/outclass/tutorial hours and have it calculate these totals.

High Priority Bugs:
ADVANCED TAGGING (ALL OPTIONS??? ALWAYS ENABLED!)
//Issue with lowest in heirarchy of tags in advanced outcomes
Comments can be dragged "behind" description box and then can no longer be clicked to be edited/deleted/moved. Needs to be fixed asap. Simple solution is to not allow comments above the first week.


High Priority:
Create a bunch of videos
Strategy text
Make the tags in the nodebar look better (smaller, cleaner, show all text on mouseover)
We seem to be able to doubly link nodes (same ports). Should we prevent this?

Medium Priority:
colouring is weird on outcome table due to the alternation, sometimes hidden rows have odd numbers which means the alternation no longer holds for the visible ones
Translate help docs
Add descriptions of icons from ALA team
New orchestration icon
Can also probably save arrow location/bends. Uses an array of "control points" in mxgeometry. 
Check out passing of information from one site to another - could be useful for creating even more general links to any courseflow?
Have an "add node" button in empty weeks
Automatic calculation of resize for dropped nodes instead of textheight
Duplicate workflow option on project overview.
Potential linking of activities to activities (perhaps a setting to enable this more advanced behaviour)


Low Priority:
Comments not sticky in safari?
We may want to add the ability to add resource links independently of the description (as a single unit)
Comments could be "part of the thing they are attached to", i.e. show up in the editbar
Recognize where page breaks should be
Don't forget automatic addition of outcomes to linked wfs has been completely disabled due to the messiness that degree of completion would cause. May be for the best...

Low priority bugs:

Ease of use/intuitiveness:
Change the left toolbar so that it sits inline with the graph container.
Have a way to link the strategies to the saltise website

Core components:
Learning objectives should be shorter? Start with verb. Use the learning outcome document/guidelines
Course Outcomes: Add performance criteria for each - a list of criteria by which the outcome is assessed. Needs to be there for at least depth 0 and 1.

Long term:

Touch compatible

Strategies should use xml files directly, not the temporary javascript definitions.

Simultaneous codesign.

Add ability to include files/materials (pdfs etc) in the package.
